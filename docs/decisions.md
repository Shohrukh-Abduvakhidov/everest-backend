# Decisions

## 2026-10-26 — Database-backed action permissions

M02F-A adds `permissions` and `role_permissions` as the reusable RBAC foundation. Runtime authorization resolves current database assignments on every protected request through repository-owned SQL; permissions are not embedded in JWTs, so assignment changes take effect without waiting for token expiry. Middleware selects the required action, the service makes the authorization decision, and repositories only answer persistence questions.

Only already-approved account-administration semantics are seeded: `accounts.pending.read`, `accounts.approve`, `accounts.reject`, `accounts.block`, and `accounts.unblock` belong to `owner` and `admin`. Existing routes, authentication ordering, `403 ADMIN_ROLE_REQUIRED`, business transactions, and audit behavior remain unchanged. No owner bypass or implicit role hierarchy exists, and no teacher/student or unresolved domain/resource permission is inferred. Permission-management APIs, rate limiting, brute-force controls, and CSRF remain outside M02F-A.

## 2026-10-25 — Password recovery proof and provider boundary

M02E returns a random opaque challenge identifier for every syntactically valid recovery request, including unknown and ineligible phones. Only its SHA-256 hash is stored for eligible delivery, so the public contract does not expose sequential IDs, account existence, Telegram linkage, throttling, or provider outcomes. Six-digit codes use cryptographic randomness and an HMAC-SHA-256 verifier keyed by `OTP_HMAC_SECRET`; defaults are a 10-minute expiry, five attempts, a 60-second resend cooldown, and five created challenges per account/channel/hour. Creating an eligible challenge invalidates every earlier active password-recovery challenge for that user.

Successful verification consumes the code and installs a separate opaque 32-byte reset authorization with only its SHA-256 hash and 10-minute expiry stored. PostgreSQL row locks serialize verification and reset. Password replacement, reset consumption, all-session/refresh revocation, and audit persistence share one transaction. Recovery is permitted for active, pending, and blocked password accounts but never changes status or roles; rejected accounts are ineligible.

Telegram delivery requires both a verified Telegram login identity and the existing active bot connection. SMS has a narrow provider interface and test double, but the production provider remains deliberately disabled because none is approved. Production SMS delivery is not claimed as implemented. The incremental migration adds Telegram challenge support plus public/reset hashes and reset expiry/consumption fields without changing the 13 published migrations.

## 2026-10-25 — Session lifecycle and refresh-token family

M02D keeps the access JWT at 15 minutes by default and adds a configurable 30-day refresh/session lifetime. Each PostgreSQL `auth_sessions` row is one refresh-token family. Refresh secrets are 32 random bytes encoded as base64url; only SHA-256 hashes are stored. Successful refresh locks the token, session, and user rows, marks the token used, inserts one replacement with the family's original expiry, updates `last_used_at`, and issues a new access JWT. Concurrent use permits at most one rotation.

Presenting a used or revoked refresh token is treated as reuse: the session and every family token are revoked and an audit event is committed before a stable unauthorized response. This also invalidates any descendant issued by a competing request. No replacement-link migration is needed because the session is the family boundary and retained token history provides replay evidence.

Browser authentication uses HttpOnly `everest_access` and `everest_refresh` cookies. The refresh cookie is restricted to `/api/v1/auth`; both cookies use `SameSite=Lax`, explicit expiry, no Domain attribute, and `Secure` in production. Logout clears cookies with matching attributes. SameSite and restricted CORS reduce exposure but do not constitute complete CSRF protection; explicit CSRF/origin hardening remains M02F.

Sessions retain the bounded login User-Agent already captured by the shared issuer and the direct request IP selected by Express without trusting forwarded headers. APIs expose only coarse browser/OS/device labels and no IP. `last_used_at` updates on every successful refresh and at most once per 60 seconds during access authentication.

## 2026-10-25 — Cross-platform migration-source verification

The exact migration-source integrity comparison normalizes only CRLF or CR line endings to LF before comparing and hashing SQL. Indentation, blank lines, tokens, comments, capitalization, and statement order remain exact. Root `.gitattributes` enforces LF for source and documentation files. No published migration content was changed.

## 2026-10-25 — Account approval administration boundary

M02C introduces only the administrator authorization needed by account-state routes: an authenticated active session plus a current `owner` or `admin` assignment queried from `user_roles`. General RBAC remains M02F. Account transitions are non-idempotent state-machine operations serialized with a row lock and audited atomically. Blocking revokes all live sessions in the same transaction; unblocking never restores them.

The initial owner is assigned only through the local `bootstrap:owner` CLI. It selects an already registered phone, takes a transaction-scoped advisory lock, refuses when any owner exists, activates the selected account, assigns the owner role, and audits the operation. It is not an HTTP endpoint or startup action.

## 2026-10-25 — Numeric internal identifier foundation

Before production data existed, M01R explicitly replaced the development migration baseline's UUID entity identifiers. Entity `id` primary keys now use `BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY`; internal foreign keys, one-to-one keys, composite relationship columns, function parameters, and polymorphic audit references use `BIGINT`. PostgreSQL generates entity IDs and repositories return them with `RETURNING`; services do not generate database entity IDs.

Node `pg` returns `BIGINT` values as strings. JWT `sub`/`sid` and API identifiers therefore use canonical positive decimal strings bounded to PostgreSQL `BIGINT`, without conversion through JavaScript `Number`. Numeric identifiers are not promised to be sequential or gapless and are never renumbered.

Randomness remains where it is part of a security or external protocol rather than entity identity: OAuth state, nonce, PKCE verifier and encryption IVs, password salts, token hashes, and provider identifiers. `sms_deliveries.idempotency_key` remains the sole UUID database column because it is an opaque retry key. The migration-cycle script also uses a random UUID only to create a collision-resistant disposable database name.

The rewrite was permitted only after confirming the local development database contained no application data beyond role seeds and taking a `pg_dump` backup. `everest_db` was dropped/recreated and migrated from the rewritten baseline; destructive rollback testing ran only against a separately created disposable database.

## 2026-10-24 — Native JavaScript ES Modules

EVEREST uses native JavaScript ES Modules throughout the backend. `package.json` declares `"type": "module"`; local imports include `.js` extensions. This explicit decision replaces the earlier provisional CommonJS fallback for an empty repository.

## 2026-10-24 — Database configuration

Application and migration processes use the same validated `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` settings from `src/configs/env.js`. `DATABASE_URL` is not required. TLS is opt-in through `DB_SSL`; certificate verification is not disabled implicitly.

## 2026-10-24 — Migration rollback safety

Initial migrations have destructive `down` operations and are intended for disposable databases only. The migration runner permits `down` only when the configured database name clearly contains `test`, `tmp`, `temp`, or `disposable`. Down migrations reverse dependencies without `CASCADE`.

## 2026-10-24 — Telegram OIDC identity and session boundary

Telegram login uses the provider's OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow with PKCE S256 and discovery metadata. The fixed expected issuer is `https://oauth.telegram.org`; ID tokens require a valid signature, audience, expiry, nonce, and non-empty subject. Only the verified `(provider, issuer, subject)` tuple is a login identity. Phone, username, and chat ID are never used to merge users.

Temporary authorization records store SHA-256 hashes of state and nonce. The PKCE verifier is encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a key derived from the configured Telegram client secret. Records expire, are atomically consumed exactly once before code exchange, and distinguish login from authenticated account linking.

Telegram login identity remains in `auth_identities`; bot messaging permission remains separately in `telegram_connections`. A verified `telegram:bot_access` grant may create or reactivate the connection. Unlinking is rejected when Telegram is the user's last login method. Link/unlink writes and audit events share one PostgreSQL transaction.

Successful login creates an `auth_sessions` row and an EVEREST HS256 session token. The callback puts the token in an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie and does not include it in JSON. Every authenticated request verifies both the token and the live, unrevoked session plus active account status.

## 2026-10-25 — Phone/password registration and login boundary

M02B registration accepts a normalizable E.164 phone, first and last names, and a password. It creates a pending user, profile, unverified non-primary phone, password credential, student role, and audit event atomically. Registration neither verifies phone ownership nor creates a session; phone verification and account approval remain later milestones.

Passwords must be 12–128 Unicode characters and contain at least one letter and one number. They are hashed asynchronously with Node.js `scrypt` using a random 16-byte salt, cost `N=16384`, `r=8`, `p=1`, and a 64-byte derived key. Stored hashes are self-describing. Verification uses `timingSafeEqual`, and unknown-phone login verifies against a valid dummy hash to reduce timing differences.

Password login uses a generic invalid-credentials response for unknown phones and wrong passwords. A correct password still requires an active account. Session creation, `last_login_at`, and a successful-login audit share one transaction; the access token uses the same server-side session and HttpOnly cookie contract as Telegram login.
